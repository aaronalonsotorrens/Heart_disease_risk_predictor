## Business Context & Case

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection of high-risk patients can significantly reduce complications and healthcare costs.  

**Business Goals:**

1. Identify patients at high risk of heart disease.
2. Understand which factors contribute most to risk.
3. Provide actionable insights for preventive healthcare interventions.
4. Deliver reproducible, interpretable machine learning pipelines.

**Success Criteria:**

- Achieve **≥80% accuracy** on classification tasks.
- Maintain **high recall** to minimize false negatives.
- Maintain clean, documented, and reusable code pipelines.

**ML Tasks Mapped to Business Case:**

- **Classification:** Predict whether a patient is at risk (`HeartDisease` 0/1).

---

## Hypotheses & Validation

Before starting the analysis, we formulated the following hypotheses:

1. **Age and cholesterol levels are positively correlated with heart disease risk.**  
   - *Validation:* Statistical tests and correlation heatmaps confirmed that higher `age` and `chol` values were more common among patients with heart disease.

2. **Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`) and maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) are associated with heart disease risk.**  
   - *Validation:* EDA showed that patients with higher `trestbps` and lower `thalach` were more likely to have heart disease. Both variables appeared as important predictors in model feature importance rankings.

3. **Machine learning models can achieve at least 80% accuracy in predicting heart disease risk.**  
   - *Validation:* Our best-performing pipeline (Random Forest) achieved test ROC-AUC > 0.80, confirming this hypothesis.

---

## Rationale Mapping

Each business requirement was mapped to a specific analysis and ML task:

- **Business Requirement 1:** Identify key factors that correlate with heart disease.  
  - *Data Task:* Exploratory analysis (heatmaps, distributions, group comparisons).  
  - *ML Task:* Feature importance ranking from Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and Logistic Regression models

- **Business Requirement 2:** Predict likelihood of heart disease for a given patient.  
  - *Data Task:* Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, cleaning).  
  - *ML Task:* Train, evaluate, and deploy classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).  
  - *Dashboard Feature:* “Patient Risk Prediction Tool” page.

## ML Business Case

The client is interested in moving beyond descriptive analysis to **predictive analytics**:

- **Problem:** Healthcare professionals and patients often lack quick, data-driven tools for estimating heart disease risk.  
- **Proposed Solution:** Develop and deploy a machine learning model that predicts individual risk based on medical and lifestyle factors.  
- **Value:**  
  - Supports earlier interventions and preventive care.
  - Helps clinicians prioritize high-risk patients.  
- **Feasibility:**  
  - Dataset includes a balanced set of medical and lifestyle features.  
  - Models achieved ROC-AUC > 0.80, confirming predictive capability.  
  - Deployment via Streamlit enables direct user interaction.

## Prediction Model Details

### Classification Model — Heart Disease Risk

We aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features. The target variable is **categorical** and contains **2 classes**:

- `0` = No heart disease  
- `1` = Presence of heart disease  

This is a **supervised, 2-class, single-label classification model**.

**Goal:**  
Provide healthcare practitioners and public health stakeholders with reliable insights to identify high-risk patients early and inform preventive interventions.

### Model Success Metrics

- **Recall ≥ 80%** for detecting patients with heart disease (`1`) on both train and test sets.  
- Precision for predicting no heart disease (`0`) should also be **≥ 80%** to avoid overestimating risk.  

**Failure Criteria:**

- If F1 for heart disease (1) < 0.8, the model risks misidentifying high-risk patients.
- If Accuracy for non-heart disease (0) < 0.8, the model may produce too many false alarms or unnecessary concern.

### Model Output

- A **binary flag**: `0` (no heart disease) or `1` (heart disease).  
- **Probability score** for each patient indicating the risk of heart disease.  

**Input Data Collection:**

- Online: patient completes a clinical form with features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, etc.  
- Offline: clinician or public health worker collects input during patient interview and enters data into the tool.  

**Inference:** Predictions are generated **on the fly**, not in batch mode.

### Training Data

- Source: UCI Heart Disease dataset via Kaggle (~1,000 patient records).  
- Features: Clinical and demographic variables, excluding identifiers.  
- Preprocessing includes handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and engineered features such as cholesterol ratios and age groups.

### Pipeline Details

1. **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.  
2. **Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and cross-validation.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
4. **Multi-class Risk Band Classification:** Patients can be categorized into `Low`, `Medium`, or `High` risk based on predicted probability thresholds.
5. **Deployment:** Saved pipeline enables real-time inference in web or API-based applications.

## Unfixed Bugs

Advanced Input Expander Behavior

- Due to the way Streamlit reruns the script on any widget interaction, the “Full Advanced Input” expander collapses
  after clicking a prediction button by default.

- This is normal behavior and not a bug.

- We handle this in the code using st.session_state so that the expander remains open after running predictions.

---

## Deployment

You can deploy this Streamlit app on Heroku by following these steps:

- Create setup.sh

Create a file named setup.sh in the project root with the following content:

mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/

echo "\
[server]\n\
headless = true\n\
port = \$PORT\n\
enableCORS = false\n\
\n\
" > ~/.streamlit/config.toml

- Create a Procfile

Create a file named Procfile (no extension) in the project root:

web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py

This tells Heroku how to start your app.

  - Login to Heroku (or create an account if needed):

  - heroku login

  - Create a new app:

    - Go to your Heroku Dashboard

    - Click Create New App.
